I graduated from Arts University of Bournemouth in June 2019 and have now moved back to Manchester. Over the past 3 years I studied photography which involved a great deal of creativity, researching, shooting, editing, collaborating, networking and exhibiting. I am interested in fashion, street style and portraits as I love collaborating with people.
